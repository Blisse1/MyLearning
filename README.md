# Public-learning

The secondary purpose of this public repository is to have also visible the list of the material I'll be following, I want to have a sense of what its like doing the usually recommended paths for learning Fullstack Web Development.

All of the notes I'll be making here its entirely for personal use and for personal reference but if someone ever wants to make a change over something, be it to add or to change something in the notes for me to understand better a certain topic, just let me know through a pull request and I'll be more than thankful to evaluate it and make changes.

## Paths
