## [[Variables]] 

The ***var*** word is called keyword, ***myName*** is the name of the variable, and ***Andres*** is called the value.

```js
var myName = "Andres";
```

It is like a box with a label outside of it. The box can save the information and even remember it for later use.

> [!example]- A prompt that remembers.
> ```js
> var yourName = prompt("What is your name?");
>```

## Naming and name convention

>[!note]
>Always give your variables meaningful names to remember that with great power comes great responsability.

>[!warning]+ Be careful!
> - You cannot name your variables with a keyword like ***var***
> - Also you cannot either start to name your variables with a ***number***
> - They cannot contain spaces.

>[!check]
> - The way you name variables can only contain letters, numbers, the dollar sign and the underscore. No other symbols are valid for naming a variable.
>- You should also use camel casing.

## Increment and decrement expressions

```js
let i = 5;
i+=2;
i++;
i--;
```

If you ever want to increment not just by one, just use the += expression to do so.
