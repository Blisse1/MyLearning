## Numbers

We don't need special symbols to tell the computer that a number is a number.

```javascript
 const number = 1991;
```

We just simply type the number.

#javascript/number

## Basic operations (Arithmetic)

Whenever we're writing some arithmetic, you should remember the hierarchy that function both in math and in programming. You should do first the multiplication and division, then sum or rest.

```js
var calculation = ((4 + 2) * 2) + 1; 
```
