## Multiple classes 

- Multiple classes can be added to an element by listing them in the class attribute and separating them with a space.

```css
/* Two classes added to the same div*/
<div class="animal dog"></div>
```

- If you add multiple classes to an HTML element, the styles of the first classes may be overridden by later classes

## CSS rule

```css
/* This whole thing is called a CSS rule.*/

h1 {
	text-align: center;
}

```
