## CSS Box Model

- Every HTML element is its own box - with its own spacing and a border. This is called the Box Model.

- In the CSS Box Model, every HTML element is treated as a box with four areas

- Imagine you receive a box from your favorite online retailer, **the content** is the item in the box.

- The content is surrounded by a space called **padding**, similar to how bubble wrap separates an item from the box around it.

- The border is like a **cardboard box** my item was shipped in.

- **Margin** is the area outside of the box, and can be used to control the space between other boxes or elements.

```html
<!-- Even though this div has no text, its still treated as a box with content 
-->
<div></div>
```
