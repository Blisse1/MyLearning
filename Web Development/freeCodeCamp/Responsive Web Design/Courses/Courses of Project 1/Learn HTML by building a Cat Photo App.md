## Extra Notes

- All page content elements that should be rendered to the page go inside the body element.

- The entire contents of the page are nested within an html element. All other elements must be descendants of this html element.

- All pages should begin with  ```html <!DOCTYPE html>```This special string is known as a declaration and ensure the browser tries to meet industry-wide specifications. So the browser knows what type of document its reading.

- You can set browser behavior by adding self-closing meta elements in the head.

>[!note]- Inline elements
>Input and button are inline elements, that means that they don't appear on new lines.
