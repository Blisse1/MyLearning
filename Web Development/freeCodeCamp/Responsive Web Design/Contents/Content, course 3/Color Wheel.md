#css/colorWheel 

-  A color wheel is a circle where similar colors or ***hues*** are near each other and different ones are further apart

- Two colors that are opposite from each other on the color wheel are called *complementary* colors. If two complementary colors are combined, they produce gray.

- But when they're placed side-by-side (as in the example), these colors produce strong visual contrast and appear brighter.

- Notice that the red and cyan colors are very bright next to each other. This contrast can distracting if its overused on a website, and can make text hard to read if its placed on a complementary-color background.

- Its better practice to choose one color as the dominant color and use its complementary color as an accent to bring attention to certain content on the page.
