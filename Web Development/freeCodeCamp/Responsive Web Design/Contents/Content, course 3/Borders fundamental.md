```css

.sleeve{
	border-left-width: 10px;
	border-left-style: solid;
	border-left-color: black; 
}

```

- These are the fundamentals for the shorthand property: 

```css
/* Shorthand property */
.sleeve {
	border-left: 10px solid black;
}
```

- It is important to know this because we always use it and we don't know that the 10px value its associated with the width of the border.
