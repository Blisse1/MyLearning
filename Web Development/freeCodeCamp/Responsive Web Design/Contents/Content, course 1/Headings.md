- The h1 through the h6 heading elements are used to signify **the importance of content** below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance.

```html
<h1>This one has more importance</h1>
<h2>Than this one!</h2>
```

+ Only use ***one h1 element*** per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.

- When you add a lower rank heading element to the page, it's implied that you're starting a new subsection.
