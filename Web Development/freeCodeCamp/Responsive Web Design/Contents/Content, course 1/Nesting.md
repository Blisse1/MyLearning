#html/nesting

<hr>

- Putting elements inside another element is called ***nesting***.

```html
<main>
	<!-- Two elements nested inside main -->
	<h1>This is a Cat Photo App!</h1>
	<h2>Cat Photos!</h2>
</main>
```

- Nested elements should be placed two spaces further to the right of the element they are nested in.

- This spaces is called ***indentation*** and it is used to make HTML easier to read.

```html
<main>
	<!-- Elements indentated one space to the right -->
	<h1>This is a Cat Photo App!</h1>
	<h2>Cat Photos!</h2>
</main>
```
