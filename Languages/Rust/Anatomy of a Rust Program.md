```rust
fn main() {
	 
}

- The main function is special: it is always the first code that runs in every executable Rust program. Here, the first line declares a function named *main* that has no parameters and returns nothing. If there were parameters, they would go inside the parentheses ().

- The function body is wrapped in {} . Rust requires curly brackets around all function bodies. It's good style to place the opening
