## Vary your coding routine.

A daily coding routine doesn't mean you have to code every day literally. Variation actually [improves learning](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4419-1428-6_415)!

Published in the Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning, Jeroen J. G. van MerriÃ«nboer wrote, "Variability of practice facilitates generalization of cognitive schemas and improves transfer of learning, that is, it is most beneficial to performance on novel rather than earlier encountered situations."

So if your routine is feeling stale, you're actually doing yourself a favor by switching it up. Here are some alternative ideas for daily coding practice:

-   Read programming blogs
-   Review someone else's code
-   Collaborate on Github
-   Pair program with a friend
-   Write about what you're learning
-   Work on problem-solving with Codewars
-   Watch code streams or tutorial videos
-   Research new tools
-   Connect with a mentor or mentee
-   Plan a personal project
-   Freshen up your portfolio
-   Take an online course
